# 99 Bottles ruby 

Run with 
```
bundle exec ruby lib/play.rb
```

Enter 99 as first and 0 as second number for the full song.


### Disclaimer 
This is by no means a try on achieving a "shameless green" or anything similar. 
This is also not meant to be "as readable as possible". This is just for the purpose of playing 
around a bit and seeing how nice object oriented programming with ruby can be. It kind of follows 
the exercises of the original book by Sandi Metz as well, but I tried to do my own thing here and there.
